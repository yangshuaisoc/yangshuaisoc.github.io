Hello, my name is Shuai Yang (杨帅). I am an assistant professor of sociology at East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST), Shanghai, China. My research interests lie in social stratification and migration studies. My study is to explore the long-term impact of being left-behind, migrant or experiencing both during childhood on individual development in adulthood. I am also interested in social adaptation and career development of Chinese students in the U.S. My current research has been published in Social Science and Medicine, Chinese Journal of Sociology (社会), International Journal of Social Psychiatry, Zhejiang Social Science(浙江社会科学), and Northwest population(西北人口).
